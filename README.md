The Attendance Calculator is a simple web application built with React and TypeScript. This tool allows students to quickly calculate their attendance percentage based on the total number of classes and the number of classes attended. It also checks if the student meets the required attendance threshold (75%) for exam eligibility.

This project is intended for anyone who wants to track their attendance and determine if they are eligible for exams based on their participation in classes.

Features:
Input for the total number of classes.
Input for the number of classes attended.
Automatic calculation of the attendance percentage.
Exam eligibility check based on the threshold (default: 75%).
User-friendly UI with responsive design.
Demo
You can run the application locally to check how it works, or use this hosted demo (if available) to try it out.

Technologies Used:
React: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
TypeScript: Superset of JavaScript for type safety and better tooling.
Tailwind CSS (optional): Utility-first CSS framework for styling.
lucide-react: A library for icons used in the app (checkmark and cross icons).
Usage
Enter the total number of classes in the input field.
Enter the number of classes you have attended.
Click the "Calculate" button to see your attendance percentage.
Based on your percentage, you will be informed whether you are eligible or not eligible for exams (with a 75% attendance threshold).
